# Oberon RISC Emulator Integrated Oberon Fork

Forked from [Peter De Wachter's RISC emulator in C](https://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu) with miscelaneous features added

* CAUTION: More features are not always better features!

Latest risc binary for Ubuntu: [risc-on-Linux](https://github.com/io-core/oberon-risc-emu/releases/download/v2021.9.4/risc-on-Linux) (Requires SDL2 installed via apt)

Latest risc binary for macOS: [risc-on-macOS](https://github.com/io-core/oberon-risc-emu/releases/download/v2021.9.4/risc-on-macOS) (Requires SDL2 installed via homebrew)

This is an emulator for the Oberon RISC machine. For more information,
[see Niklaus Wirth's site](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/). For
newcomers to the Oberon family of operating systems, the document
[Using Oberon] in the [Project Oberon section] is a must-read.

## Building

To build the emulator, you need the SDL2 library and a C compiler that
understands C99 (GCC and clang are fine).

[SDL2]: http://libsdl.org/

### Linux

To install the needed packages on Debian, Ubuntu and derived
distributions, use this command:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev

See your distribution's documentation if you're using something else.

After that, build the emulator using the command `make`.

### OS X

I can't give much support for OS X, but I've had many reports saying
it works fine. The main stumbling block seems to be that there are two
ways to install the SDL development files: Unix style and Xcode style,
as explained in the [SDL Mac OS X FAQ].

For Unix style, build using the command `make`.
For Xcode style, use `make osx`.

[SDL Mac OS X FAQ]: https://wiki.libsdl.org/FAQMacOSX

### Windows

There's a pre-compiled version in Github's Releases section.

See the [SDL site][SDL2]  for how to set up a compiler
for Windows. It's fiddly.

Alternatively, you can set up a cross compiler from Linux, which is
also rather fiddle, and build with a command such as: (This is mostly
for my own future reference.)

    make CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc-win32 \
         SDL2_CONFIG=/usr/local/cross-tools/i686-w64-mingw32/bin/sdl2-config


## Disk image

You can find an up-to-date disk image in the [DiskImage/](DiskImage/)
directory. These images contain a full Project Oberon 2013 system,
with all source code, symbol files, etc.

They also have a few tweaks for better integration with the emulator
(though it should still work fine on real hardware):

* The Display module supports variable display resolution. (The
  original module was hardcoded for 1024x768.)

* There's a Clipboard module for basic clipboard integration,
  documented below.

The source code for these modifications can be found in the
[Mods/](Mods/) directory. The tools to generate the disk image exist
in the [Project Norebo] repository.

[Project Norebo]: https://github.com/pdewacht/project-norebo


## Command line options

Usage: `risc [options] disk-image.dsk`

* `--fullscreen` Start the emulator in fullscreen mode.
* `--mem <megs>` Give the system more than 1 megabyte of RAM.
* `--size <width>x<height>` Use a non-standard window size.
* `--leds` Print the LED changes to stdout. Useful if you're working on the kernel,
  noisy otherwise.

## Keyboard and mouse

The Oberon system assumes you use a US keyboard layout and a three button mouse.
You can use the left alt key to emulate a middle click.

The following keys are available:
* `Alt-F4` Quit the emulator.
* `F11` or `Shift-Command-F` Toggle fullscreen mode.
* `F12` Soft-reset the Oberon machine.


## Transferring files

First start the PCLink1 task by middle-clicking on the PCLink1.Run command.
Transfer files using the pcreceive.sh and pcsend.sh scripts.

Alternatively, use the clipboard integration to exchange text.


## Clipboard integration

The Clipboard module provides access to the host operating system's
clipboard using these commands:

* `Clipboard.Paste`
* `Clipboard.CopySelection`
* `Clipboard.CopyViewer`


## Known issues

* The wireless network interface is not emulated.
* Proper documentation is needed.
